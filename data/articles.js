# Understanding Evaluation Criteria

Choosing a financial advisor is one of the most significant financial decisions you will make. With more than 11,000+ registered advisory firms in the U.S., understanding the evaluation criteria used by regulators helps you identify trustworthy professionals. This guide breaks down the essential SEC filing components so you can evaluate any firm confidently.

---

## 1. Services & Specializations: What Exactly Do They Offer?

A firm’s mandatory ADV filings list every advisory service they provide. This helps you determine if their expertise matches your needs.

### Key indicators:
- Whether they manage investments or only provide planning advice  
- Whether they specialize in retirement, tax, or estate strategies  
- Whether they offer discretionary or non-discretionary portfolio management  
- Whether they work with individuals, high-net-worth clients, or institutions  

Understanding these areas helps you confirm whether the firm is capable of meeting your long-term goals.

---

## 2. Fees & Compensation: Are They Transparent?

Advisor fee structures vary significantly. Firms must disclose all compensation models clearly in their ADV Part 2A.

### What to review:
- Percentage-based fees vs. flat fees  
- Hourly or project-based rates  
- Whether they earn commissions from product sales  
- Whether fees are negotiable  
- Additional costs such as custodial or transaction fees  

A transparent firm explains fees in plain language and provides sample cost breakdowns.

---

## 3. Assets Under Management (AUM): What Does Size Tell You?

A firm’s AUM indicates the scale of its operations.

### What AUM tells you:
- Resources and infrastructure available  
- The average size of client accounts  
- Whether they work with clients similar to you  
- Whether growth is stable over time  

A high AUM may indicate strong trust and long-term client satisfaction, but smaller firms may offer more personalized service.

---

## 4. Disclosure History & Regulatory Background

The SEC requires firms and advisors to disclose disciplinary, legal, and regulatory events.

### Be cautious if you see:
- Regulatory sanctions  
- Fraud or misrepresentation cases  
- Customer disputes  
- Criminal disclosures  
- Suspensions or revoked registrations  

A clean disclosure record doesn’t guarantee quality — but a problematic one should prompt deeper investigation.

---

## 5. Experience & Professional Background

Advisor and firm experience is essential for judging professional competence.

### Important considerations:
- Total years in business  
- Individual advisor’s qualifications  
- Professional designations (CFP®, CFA®, CPA, etc.)  
- Specializations in retirement, tax, estate, or investment strategy  

Advisors with proven backgrounds inspire trust and reliability.

---

## 6. Investment Process & Philosophy

A strong investment philosophy indicates discipline and consistency.

You should understand:
- Whether they use passive or active strategies  
- Their approach to risk  
- How they diversify portfolios  
- How often portfolios are monitored and adjusted  

---

## Putting It All Together

By understanding regulatory filings, fee structures, firm history, and advisor experience, you can confidently choose a financial advisor who aligns with your expectations. Evaluation is a holistic process — not a one-step decision.

# Financial Planning 101

Many young persons may view planning for retirement as something to consider when they're closer to their middle ages, or when they have the "dream job" or have "settled down." This is a common mistake that will cost you YEARS of potential investment returns that you will NEVER get back.

When planning for the future, **time** is by and large the most valuable asset at one's disposal. Organizing your finances as a youthful individual is also incredibly simple, and can be *done yourself*.

Make sure that your financial "house" is in order before devising a plan to save and invest your cash to fund your future goals. As a young person, there are not many hoops to jump through, but there are certain items to address in order to prevent a financial catastrophe and to ensure you maximize your money's potential.

## Investment Accounts

The most common type of investment accounts available to the average investor includes Employer-sponsored plans (401k, 403b, etc.), Individual Retirement Accounts (Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, etc.), and investment accounts (Non-retirement accounts).

### Employer-sponsored Retirement plans

**Employer-sponsored Retirement plans:** These plans are the most commonly available to US employees by and large. Defined contribution plans are predominantly **Pre-tax/Traditional** (monies taxed when withdrawn, ideally in retirement) or **After-tax/Roth** (monies taxed now, growing tax-free for your lifetime) and allow for employees to contribute a maximum of \$24,500 (2026) each year, along with the employer being able (*though may not be required*) to **contribute** a percentage of an employee's salary into the account.

How does one "invest" in their employer-sponsored plan? This depends on the custodian your employer has elected to **oversee** employee accounts. I stress the word "oversee" as it is purely the responsibility of the employee to manage their own investments in the account, the plan provider is simply the custodian of employee accounts.

Many employers will use Vanguard, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and others to custody their company's plan. Depending on how much your employer is willing to spend, a predetermined list of investments will be available to choose from ("investment options").

The information discussed above is more than enough for most people to be aware of, but the details can be viewed in greater depth here.

## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

**Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs):**

**IRAs (Traditional or Roth):** Individual Retirement Accounts are *self-funded* retirement accounts, with no affiliation to an employer-sponsored account. IRAs are *individual*, meaning they are not "joint" accounts owned by two or more persons. All that is required in order to contribute funds to an IRA is to have "earned income." If single, you must earn an equal amount of taxable income that is contributed, spouses may contribute for each other if one is not working. Certain income amounts will phase out an individual or couple from contributing to an IRA, view the details here.

**Roth IRA (The tax-free individual retirement account):** Roths are arguably the most efficient retirement account that an individual can contribute to, especially a young person. This is primarily due to benefitting from decades of *tax-free* compounding growth inside an investment account.

As an individual naturally progresses in their career, so will their income and as a result, the rate at which they will be expected to pay taxes. The key to a Roth is to invest as much as possible into the account until the IRS no longer allows *direct* contributions, which is when a single person's income crosses over \$153,000 (2026) or a married couple surpasses \$242,000 of income. There are strategies to side-step this income limitation.

![Roth IRA](/roth-ira-diagram.png)

**Benefits:**

- The investment earnings in the account can be withdrawn completely tax free* in retirement (age 59 ½).  
- Years of compounding interest on investment earnings.  
- The Roth IRA can double as a "catastrophe fund," allowing for penalty-free withdrawals in the case of death, disability, unpaid medical expenses, and more.

## Taxable Investment Accounts

**Taxable Investment Accounts:** Some of the most notable benefits associated with these accounts are that no maximum annual contribution applies, no withdrawal penalties do either, and they can be jointly owned by 2 or more persons. The IRS allows this to take place as they will be able to collect taxes on profits gained in the account.

There are limited tax-shelter benefits offered as opposed to those available with retirement accounts. The taxation of an investment account is slightly more complicated than is the case with retirement accounts, but it is still relatively straightforward. No tax is owed from the account until a "gain" occurs (or is realized) in excess of the amount originally invested. This "gain" can take on a few different forms, such as a capital gain, dividend, or distribution.

### Capital Gains: Not all gains are created equal

- **Short-term Capital Gains:** An investment is bought and sold (realized) within 1-year (<365 days). The gain on the investment will be taxed at the income tax rate the individual is subject to.

  For example, if a single share of Microsoft (MSFT) is purchased at \$220 and sold within 1-year for \$300, taxes owed on that share of stock amount to the \$80 gain multiplied by the owner’s corresponding ordinary income tax rate.

- **Long-term Capital Gains:** An investment is bought and sold (realized) outside of 1-year (>365 days). The gain on the investment will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate the individual is subject to. This is a separate bracket altogether from income tax rates, and the rates are much more favorable. This is the government's way of encouraging longer-term stock ownership, rather than gambling with the stock market (day trading).

  For example, if a single share of Microsoft (MSFT) is purchased at \$220 and sold outside of 1-year for \$300, taxes owed on that share of stock amount to the \$80 gain multiplied by the owner’s corresponding capital gains tax rate.

**Income:** Income generated within a taxable account is also subject to tax, this may be in the form of a dividend, distribution, or interest.

- **Dividends:** Dividends are paid to shareholders as determined by a company’s board of directors. Dividends received from a US-based company are deemed “Qualified” and are subject to capital gains rates for taxation reasons, while foreign companies pay out “Non-Qualified” dividends and are subject to ordinary income tax rates.  
- **Distributions:** These are cash payments received from an investment, typically paid out by a Mutual fund as a result of a sale taking place within the fund. The distribution will be characterized as a short-term (ordinary income) or a long-term (capital gains) distribution, depending on how long the securities were held.  
- **Interest:** Income received from a checking/savings account, CD, or bond, is subject to ordinary income tax rates.

## Which accounts should you utilize to fund your goals?

**Short-term goals** (house down payment, emergency fund, additional savings, etc.):

- Utilizing a taxable investment account may be your best bet. Withdrawing funds from a retirement account is not preferable as these funds are best used to capitalize on long-term growth for retirement, premature withdrawals will stunt their growth.  
- In certain situations, a loan from your 401(k) may be an option to consider. Each plan will vary in its rules and regulations in allowing withdrawals, and should only be considered for smart purchases that will help grow your net worth (buying a house *may* be a good idea, but buying a car is likely NOT). Keep in mind a loan from your 401(k) is required to be paid with interest to avoid penalties, but the interest will essentially be used to pay yourself back. Ideally, loans from a retirement plan should probably be avoided.

**Long-term goals:**

- Tax-advantaged accounts are probably the best option to consider when planning for your long-term goals, which should include planning for retirement. The more you save, the more likely you are to accumulate wealth tax-efficiently and fund your financial independence.

# Going Beyond SEC Filings: Questions to Ask an Advisor

Evaluating advisory firms goes beyond basic service lists and fee schedules. Consider asking your advisor or prospective advisor these questions:

## 1. Security

Be sure your information and assets are in safe hands.

**You should ask:**

- How does the firm facilitate money transfers?
- How are records kept secure?
- How is sensitive information communicated effectively and securely?

## 2. Client Retention & New Relationships

High long-term client retention is one of the strongest indicators of advisor trust and satisfaction, and it is important to understand how an advisor evaluates if a prospect is a “good fit.”

**You should ask:**

- What stage of life is your typical client in?
- Do you have a client niche?
- What is the long term vision for the firm?

## 3. Investment Philosophy

Determine whether a firm’s philosophy pertaining to investment management fits your needs.

**You should ask:**

- What is your process for determining an investment recommendation?
- Does your philosophy favor low-cost, passive investing?
- Do alternative investments warrant inclusion in your recommendations?
- Which benchmark(s) are used to ensure competitive market returns?

## 4. Operational Strength & Team Expertise

Advisory firms with strong internal structure may deliver consistent service.

**You should ask:**

- What is the “Advisor-to-client” ratio?
- Dedicated service team(s)?

## 5. Services Provided

Which financial planning services are ultimately provided.

**You should ask:**

- How are comprehensive financial planning services delivered? (Retirement Planning, Investments, Insurance, Tax Planning, Estate Planning)
- Are ongoing services provided, outside of regular progress meeting(s)?
- Meeting availability: In-person, virtual, both?

## Final Thoughts

Selecting the right financial advisor requires looking beyond surface-level credentials, fee schedules, and regulatory filings. The most meaningful insights often come from understanding how a firm operates, communicates, and aligns with its clients over time.

By asking thoughtful questions about security, client relationships, investment philosophy, operational strength, and the scope of services provided, you gain a clearer picture of whether an advisory firm is built to support your long-term financial goals. These conversations reveal not only how an advisor manages money, but how they manage trust, accountability, and continuity.
