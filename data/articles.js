# Understanding Evaluation Criteria

Choosing a financial advisor is one of the most significant financial decisions you will make. With more than 11,000+ registered advisory firms in the U.S., understanding the evaluation criteria used by regulators helps you identify trustworthy professionals. This guide breaks down the essential SEC filing components so you can evaluate any firm confidently.

---

## 1. Services & Specializations: What Exactly Do They Offer?

A firm’s mandatory ADV filings list every advisory service they provide. This helps you determine if their expertise matches your needs.

### Key indicators:
- Whether they manage investments or only provide planning advice  
- Whether they specialize in retirement, tax, or estate strategies  
- Whether they offer discretionary or non-discretionary portfolio management  
- Whether they work with individuals, high-net-worth clients, or institutions  

Understanding these areas helps you confirm whether the firm is capable of meeting your long-term goals.

---

## 2. Fees & Compensation: Are They Transparent?

Advisor fee structures vary significantly. Firms must disclose all compensation models clearly in their ADV Part 2A.

### What to review:
- Percentage-based fees vs. flat fees  
- Hourly or project-based rates  
- Whether they earn commissions from product sales  
- Whether fees are negotiable  
- Additional costs such as custodial or transaction fees  

A transparent firm explains fees in plain language and provides sample cost breakdowns.

---

## 3. Assets Under Management (AUM): What Does Size Tell You?

A firm’s AUM indicates the scale of its operations.

### What AUM tells you:
- Resources and infrastructure available  
- The average size of client accounts  
- Whether they work with clients similar to you  
- Whether growth is stable over time  

A high AUM may indicate strong trust and long-term client satisfaction, but smaller firms may offer more personalized service.

---

## 4. Disclosure History & Regulatory Background

The SEC requires firms and advisors to disclose disciplinary, legal, and regulatory events.

### Be cautious if you see:
- Regulatory sanctions  
- Fraud or misrepresentation cases  
- Customer disputes  
- Criminal disclosures  
- Suspensions or revoked registrations  

A clean disclosure record doesn’t guarantee quality — but a problematic one should prompt deeper investigation.

---

## 5. Experience & Professional Background

Advisor and firm experience is essential for judging professional competence.

### Important considerations:
- Total years in business  
- Individual advisor’s qualifications  
- Professional designations (CFP®, CFA®, CPA, etc.)  
- Specializations in retirement, tax, estate, or investment strategy  

Advisors with proven backgrounds inspire trust and reliability.

---

## 6. Investment Process & Philosophy

A strong investment philosophy indicates discipline and consistency.

You should understand:
- Whether they use passive or active strategies  
- Their approach to risk  
- How they diversify portfolios  
- How often portfolios are monitored and adjusted  

---

## Putting It All Together

By understanding regulatory filings, fee structures, firm history, and advisor experience, you can confidently choose a financial advisor who aligns with your expectations. Evaluation is a holistic process — not a one-step decision.

# Mastering Financial Ratios

Financial ratios provide a powerful way to interpret a company's performance, stability, and long-term potential. Mastering them helps investors, analysts, and advisors make data-driven decisions.

---

## 1. Liquidity Ratios: Can the Company Meet Short-Term Obligations?

Liquidity ratios show how well a company can pay off its current debts.

### Key ratios:
- **Current Ratio** — Measures short-term financial strength  
- **Quick Ratio** — Measures ability to cover liabilities without inventory  
- **Cash Ratio** — Measures pure cash coverage capability  

Higher liquidity means the company can handle downturns more effectively.

---

## 2. Profitability Ratios: Is the Business Generating Enough Returns?

These ratios measure how effectively a company converts revenue into profit.

### Important ratios:
- **Net Profit Margin**  
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**  
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**  
- **Gross Profit Margin**  

Strong profitability indicates efficient operations and strong market positioning.

---

## 3. Leverage Ratios: How Much Debt Does the Company Use?

Leverage ratios show how aggressively a company borrows.

### Watch for:
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**  
- **Interest Coverage Ratio**  
- **Debt-to-Assets Ratio**  

Higher leverage means higher risk — but also higher growth potential if managed well.

---

## 4. Efficiency Ratios: How Effectively Are Resources Being Used?

Efficiency ratios help measure operational performance.

### Useful metrics:
- **Asset Turnover Ratio**  
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**  
- **Receivables Turnover Ratio**  

These ratios highlight management efficiency and operational discipline.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding financial ratios helps you see beyond marketing language and into the real health of a company. Whether you're investing, advising clients, or comparing firms, ratio analysis is an essential tool.
